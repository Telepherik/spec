# Telepherik specification
Telepherik is a standard for describing communication protocols in a language-agnostic way and generating code capable of consuming them. This repository contains the specification document which describes how
implementations of Telepherik should operate such that protocols defined with Telepherik can be used correctly in any language or toolkit.

## Disclaimer
Telepherik is currently in an Alpha stage, with regular changes to the specification likely to occur. It is not considered ready for production at the moment.

## Version
The specification currently describes version a1 of the standard. For more information on handling versions, consult the specification document.
